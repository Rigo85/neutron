1. Each player's five soldiers are initially set up on the first rank of each player's side. The first rank is also called the home rank.

2. One player plays the White soldiers, and the other plays the Black soldiers, however, any two colors or distinguishable pieces are appropriate.

3. Soldiers move orthogonally or diagonally through or onto unoccupied spaces. They must also move as far as they can until they are blocked by a piece or find the edge of the board.

4. The Neutron is initially located in the center of the board. The Neutron is played by both players in the game. It moves exactly like the soldiers.

5. White or Black may start first. Players alternate their turns. The first player can only move a soldier. From there on, players must move the Neutron first, and then one of their soldiers to complete their turn. Therefore, each player is moving two pieces in their turn with the exception of the first player's first turn.
